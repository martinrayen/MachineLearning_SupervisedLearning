Dataset : Use the amazon food reviews dataset to apply text vectorization techniques such as 
Bag of words(BoW), TermFrequency-InverseDocumentFrequency(TF-IDF) and AverageWord2Vec to process unstructured data and perform Senitiment polarity using the below mentioned Supervised Learning algorithms.

Algorithms covered include : 
  K-Nearest Neighbours(k-NN), 
  NaiveBayes(NB), 
  Logistic Regression(LR), 
  Support Vector Machines(SVM) - Linear and RBF.
